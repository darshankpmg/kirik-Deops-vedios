Basic Docker Commands:

To see all images present in your local repo:
# docker images

To find out images in docker hub
# docker search image_name

To download image from dockerhub to local machine
# docker pull image_name

To give a name to container
# docker run -it --name new_name image_name /bin/bash

To check service start or not (status)
# docker service status

To start: #docker service start
To stop: # docker service stop

To start container
#docker start container_name

To go inside container
# docker attach container_name

To see all comtainers
# docker ps -a

To see running containers
# docker ps

To stop container
# docker stop container_name

To delete a container
# docker rm container_name

To delete a docker image
# docker rmi image_name

Create container from our own Image:

Login into AWS account and start your EC2 instance, access it from putty.
Now we have to create container from our own image. Therefore, create one container first:

#docker run -it â€“name container_name image_name /bin/bash
#cd tmp/

Now create one file inside this tmp directory
# touch myfile

Now if you want to see the difference between the basic image and the changes on it
# docker diff container_name image_name

Now create image of this container
# docker commit newcontainer_name image_name
# docker images

Now create container from this image
# docker run -it --name newcontanier_name image_name /bin/bash
# ls# cd tmp
# ls (you will get all of your files)
